World of Warcraft DBC Library
=============================

Copyright (c) 2011 Tim Kurvers <http://www.moonsphere.net>

This library allows creation, reading and export of World of Warcraft's  
client-side database files. These so-called DBCs store information  
required by the client to operate successfully and can be extracted  
from the MPQ archives of the actual game client.  

**Required PHP version: 5.x**

Getting Started
---------------

Will be adding a quick-start quide soon.


Usage Notes
-----------

* String localization will only provide accurate results when used with  
the US English (enUS) or British English (enGB) distributed DBCs.

* Attempting to read DBCs with a non-standard field size, **may fail**.
